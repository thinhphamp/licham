# Development Rules

These rules are specific to the Lịch Việt project.

## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript for all code.
- Follow strict typing.
- Use functional components and hooks for React Native UI.
- Use `useTheme` hook for all colors and styling (support both light and dark mode).
- Use `AccessibleText` for all text elements to ensure consistent typography and accessibility.
- Keep components focused and modular. If a file exceeds 200 lines, consider breaking it down.
- Follow the project structure defined in `README.md`.

## State Management
- State should be managed using `Zustand`.
- Persistent data should be stored using `MMKV`.
- Event notifications should be synchronized with the `eventStore`.

## UI/UX
- Maintain a premium design aesthetic using Vietnamese cultural motifs (deep crimson, golden yellow).
- Ensure all components look good in both light and dark modes.
- Every interactive element must have a unique, descriptive ID.
- Provide comprehensive VoiceOver support for all lunar date information.

## Documentation
- Document any complex logic, especially lunar calendar algorithms.
- Keep the `docs/` folder updated with any significant architecture changes.
